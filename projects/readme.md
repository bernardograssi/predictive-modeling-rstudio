# Predictive Modeling Projects

## Description
These projects are all smale-scale projects that aimed at building the foundations for the large-scale final project. They contain short chunks of code that allowed me to have a better understanding of how these models work in R, how to build them, how to utilize the parameters, how to clean and modify the data for the purposes of the models.
